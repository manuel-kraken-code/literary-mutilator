	<p id="font">Every day is taco ipsum tuesday. Make it a double there pal. It’s long been rumored that the chupacabra is really just a crazed man who’s local taco shop went out of business. It’s taco time all the time. Um, Tabasco? No thanks, do you have any Cholula? Tacos for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Ooh, with diced onions and a pinch of cilantro. How do you feel about hard shelled tacos? Tacos, tacos, tacos. I’d have to say, those tacos are on fleek. Say taco one more time.

		<p>You see, the refried beans are really just the adhesive necessary to apply the soft tortilla to the hard taco shell. How bout a gosh darn quesadilla? Let’s do a beef and a chicken, and one with both. Carne asada on corn tortillas. Tacos al pastor made with adobada meat. Make it a double there pal. I think I’ve overdosed on tacos. I’ve been following that taco truck around all day. Tacos for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Yeah, apparently the taco shack was robbed. They left the money but took the tacos.</p>
